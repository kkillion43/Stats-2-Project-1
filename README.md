Intelligence and Class as Predictors of Future Income (Males only)



## Introduction 

Our group decided to work on problem 12.23, "Intelligence and Class
as Predictors of Future Income (Males only)," and the corresponding data set
in our textbook, Ramsey, Fred; Schafer, Daniel. The Statistical Sleuth: A
Course in Methods of Data Analysis (Page 380). Cengage Textbook. Kindle
Edition.  This data set is based on a widely publicized and
controversial book, The Bell Curve: Intelligence and Class Structure in
American Life, by psychologist Richard Hernstein
and political scientist Charles Murray. 
The book argues that intelligence is a better predictor of financial
income than other factors such as socioeconomic status or education.  The
controversy occurred because some contended the ASVAB intelligence score, AFQT,
which was used in the study, was not an accurate intelligence test, the book
was racist due to the book's statements about race and intelligence, and the
data from The National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY79) did not support
the authors' claims. This paper is
a statistical analysis of the data set to
understand and substantiate if the data
set does or does not support the authors' claims that intelligence is a better
predictor of income and to search for the best possible model of predictors of
income based on the given flawed or unflawed data set.
